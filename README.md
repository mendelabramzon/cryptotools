## eth-to-usd converter
Save this script in a file, for example, eth-to-usd.sh, and then make it executable using the following command:

chmod +x eth-to-usd.sh
To convert a specific amount of Ethereum (ETH) to USD and round the result up to the nearest 0.1, type the following command in your terminal, replacing X with the amount of ETH you want to convert:

bash
Copy code
./eth-to-usd.sh X
The script will output the equivalent value in USD rounded up to the nearest 0.1. For example, if you want to convert 2.5 ETH to USD and round up the result, you would type:

bash
Copy code
./eth-to-usd.sh 2.5
And the output will be something like:

Copy code
2.5 ETH = 799.0 USD
